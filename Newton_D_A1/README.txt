I used the following website articles to learn specific C++ syntax and applications:

    - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/command-line-arguments-in-cpp/
    - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/destructors-c/
    - https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_files.asp
    - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9579930/how-to-separate-a-class-and-its-member-functions-into-header-and-source-files
    - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43629363/how-to-check-if-a-string-contains-a-char
I also used examples shown in class as broad references for file, class, and method formatting.
